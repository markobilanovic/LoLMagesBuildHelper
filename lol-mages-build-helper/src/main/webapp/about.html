			<h1 style="color:#5ED437">1. What is this, and how should I use it?</h1>
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
				<strong><em>LoL Mages Build Helper</em></strong> is project made as a submission for 
				<a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/contests/riot-games-api-challenge-20">Riot API Challenge 2.0</a></br>
				Purpose of this website is to help LoL players to learn which items should they buy in certain matchups, 
				in different phases of the game.</br>
				Because of the size of project, this website supports creation of item sets for 
				<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Mage_champion">mages</a> only...for now.
			</p>
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
				On home page there are ten champion picker controls. One is for champion that you are playing, 
				one for enemy champion that you are laning against, 4 are for allies that you are playing with, 
				and remaining 4 are for rest of the enemy champions.</br>
				But to get an item set you don't need to pick all ten champions, only two is enough: 'My Champion' and 'Enemy Laner'.</br>
				After hitting the button <em style="color:#F70505">Calculate</em> item set will be shown on bottom of the page, 
				and on the right side there will be button <em style="color:#F70505">Download</em> so that players could import that item set 
				into the game.
			</p>

		<div class="row">
			<h1 style="color:#5ED437">2. How it's made?</h1>
			
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
			Determining if item was good or bad for certain matchup is done by grading efficiency of champions after buying 
			predefined items. </br>
			Surely when players are much better then opponent they could buy even some not so good items and still 
			perform better then opponent. That is something we will let it slide...hopefully 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> will solve this problem.
			</p>

			<h3 style="color:#5ED437; padding-left:1em"><i>2.1. Grading analysis</i></h3>
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
			Current state of champion progress is graded with values of 
			<strong><a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gold">TOTAL GOLD</a> and <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_(champion)">XP</a></strong>.</br>
			"Where is KDA in all of this?" - 
			Killing or assisting in kills gives champion XP and GOLD, so KDA is ignored and 
			these two paremeters have been named as valid ones.</br>
			After analyzing values of total gold and XP it was concluded that they have similar values while the match is passing by,</br>
			so merging these two values into one is done by simple summation <i><em style="color:#F70505">(GRADE = TOTAL GOLD + XP)</em></i>.</br>
			Grades are assigned to items, and item with highest grade is best for selected combination of champion matchup.</br>
			Items are graded separately in different periods of game. There are 5 defined periods:
			</p>	
			<ul style="color:#5ED437">
			  <li>Starting items</li>
			  <li>Early game items</li>
			  <li>Mid game losing items</li>
			  <li>Mid game winning items</li>
			  <li>Late game items</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3 style="color:#5ED437; padding-left:1em"><i>2.2. Realization</i></h3>
			
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
			After determining what and how it should be made, making Class Diagram can start. Every mage has it's enemy laner, allies and other enemies, and all of those relations should have grade for every item in already defined periods of game. Here is a result:
			</p>
			<div style="text-align: center">
				<img src="img/ClassDiagram_Model.jpg" style="width:75%"></img>
				<p style="color:#5ED437">Image 1. Class Diagram of model</p>
			</div>
			</br>
			<p style="color:#5ED437">
			Around 200.000 matches after patch 5.14 were processed. And every match went trough process described in this pseudo code:
			</p>
			<pre>FOR EACH champion IN match
	IF champion IS solo lane AND champion IS mage THEN
		FOR EACH event IN match_timeline
			IF event_type IS item_purchased
				IF item IS one of defined ap items
					write down my_champion_grade before and after 10min
					write down enemy_laner_grade before and after 10min
					write down my_team_grade before and after 10min
					write down enemy_team_ggrade before and after 10min
					laning_grade = (my_champion_grade_end - enemy_laner_grade_end) - (my_champion_grade_start - enemy_laner_grade_start)
					team_grade = ((my_team_grade_end - enemy_team_grade_end) - (my_team_grade_start - enemy_team_grade_start)) / 5
					
					IF item IS bought before 10min 
						early_game_item UPDATE grade based on laning_grade
					ELSE IF item IS bought before 22min
						IF my_champion_grade_before IS less then enemy_champion_grade_before
							mid_game_losing_item UPDATE grade based on team_grade
						ELSE
							mid_game_winning_item UPDATE grade based on team_grade
					ELSE
						late_game_item UPDATE grade based on team_grade
				ELSE IF item IS purchased before 2:30
					write down my_champion_grade before and after 7min
					write down enemy_laner_grade before and after 7min
					laning_grade = (my_champion_grade_end - enemy_laner_grade_end) - (my_champion_grade_start - enemy_laner_grade_start)
					starting_items UPDATE grade based on laning_grade</pre>
